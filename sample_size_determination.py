# Lets say have a baseline web portal click-through rate of 10% and want to
# see a manipulation increase this baseline to 12%. How many observations would
# we need in each group in order to detect this change with power  1−𝛽=.80
# (i.e. detect the 2% absolute increase 80% of the time), at a Type I error
# rate of  𝛼=.05 ?
